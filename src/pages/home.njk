        <h2>Hi, I'm {{ site.name }}.</h2>
        <p>I'm a CS Master's student at UC San Diego, currently researching real-time SLAM for surgical robotics at the Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab. Previously, I led wildlife-tracking projects at Engineers for Exploration, building drone-based radio telemetry systems and computer vision pipelines. I love tackling problems at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and systems engineering.</p>
