This class was largely a single project-based course where people pitched ideas for embedded systems and worked in teams to design, prototype, and test them over the course of the quarter. I pitched a project and ended up working on a different one, automating the movement of a **Boston Dynamics Spot** robot using **ROS1** and various sensors.
