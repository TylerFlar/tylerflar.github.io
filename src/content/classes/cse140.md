In this class we learned how to:
- Work with **Boolean algebra & logic gates** (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR).
- Convert between **truth tables**, **Boolean expressions**, and **logic diagrams**.
- Use **Karnaugh maps** (**K-maps**) to minimize combinational circuits in **SOP** and **POS** form.
- Understand **sequential logic**: latches, D flip-flops, and how to read/complete **timing diagrams** (setup/hold, clock behavior).
- Design and analyze **finite state machines** (**FSMs**):
  - State diagrams ↔ transition tables ↔ implementation with flip-flops + logic.
- See how these pieces fit into simple **processor**/**control**/**memory system designs** (basic system-level digital design ideas).
