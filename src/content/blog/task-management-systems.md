title: "Building a College Task Management System"

One of the biggest jumps from high school to college (for me) wasn’t the difficulty — it was the *lack of structure*.

High school is basically pre-scheduled: same classes, same times, same rhythm. College was the opposite. Every class ran differently, with different platforms and wildly different grading setups (anything from “just a midterm/final” to weekly homework, labs, projects, and quizzes).

Here are the systems I tried to keep up — what worked, what didn’t, and what I use now.

---

## TL;DR

- **Winging it** works… until you get busy.
- **Google Calendar** is great for hard deadlines, not long-term projects.
- **Planner/time-blocking** is powerful but high maintenance.
- **Reclaim.ai** is the first system that scaled when I had a lot going on.

## System 1: Just winging it

In high school I didn’t even set an alarm, so in college I tried keeping everything in my head.

It worked longer than it should have (I only missed one assignment out of ~50), but the system had no “memory.” As soon as my workload got heavier, it turned from a strategy into a risk.

### Pros
- Zero setup
- Fine when life is simple

### Cons
- Easy to forget things
- No planning ahead
- Falls apart when you get busy

## System 2: Google Calendar (events + reminders)

This was my first real system. I made an event for each assignment with the due date/time and a reminder (usually 24 hours before).

For classes with clear deadlines, it was amazing. I’d check what was urgent, do that, repeat — and I started finishing things early.

The limitation showed up with extracurriculars and research: the work is real, but deadlines are fuzzy. Calendar events tell you **what’s due**, but not always **what to do next**.

### Pros
- Great for hard deadlines
- Easy weekly overview
- Low effort once it’s a habit

### Cons
- Weak for long-term, open-ended work
- Can become cluttered or ignored over time

## System 3: Franklin Covey-style planning (but digital)

I wanted something that felt more like an actual plan. I tried a Franklin Covey planner, then switched to a OneNote template that mimicked it.

The biggest win here was **time-blocking**: assigning my day in 30-minute chunks. When I stuck with it, I felt super in control — and it made my plans more realistic.

But it was also a lot of overhead. When I got stressed or tired, the planning was the first thing to slip. In reality, most days I only filled out the to-do list and skipped the time-blocking.

### Pros
- Strong prioritization
- Time-blocking keeps plans realistic
- Good for breaking down big projects

### Cons
- High maintenance
- Easy to drop during busy weeks

## System 4: Reclaim.ai (auto-scheduling)

This is what finally scaled. Reclaim turns tasks into actual calendar blocks automatically based on your availability.

The best part: the system doesn’t “break” if you have an off day. If I ignored the schedule, I could come back the next day and tasks would reshuffle automatically.

The main challenge is estimating time and inventing deadlines for open-ended work — but once you get decent at that (and adjust as you go), it’s incredibly effective.

### Pros
- Auto-schedules tasks into real time
- Reschedules automatically when plans change
- Makes long-term work visible week-to-week

### Cons
- Requires rough time estimates
- Paid tool
- Can feel too calendar-heavy for some people

## What I use now

My current setup is simple:

- **Calendar for reality** (classes, meetings, hard deadlines)
- **Auto-scheduler for execution** (ongoing tasks/projects)
- **Quick weekly review** to clean things up and reset priorities

The main lesson: the best system is the one that still works when you’re tired, busy, and overwhelmed — not the one that’s perfect on an ideal week.
